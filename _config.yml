  Software Engineer at NVIDIA with 10+ years building and operating large-scale infrastructure and automation.

  Experienced across SRE/DevOps and platform engineering—reliability engineering, incident response, distributed systems operations, and CI/CD-driven automation.

  I focus on reducing operational toil, improving availability, and shipping pragmatic tooling that scales across regions and teams.

  Born and raised in Mumbai, where I completed my schooling and undergraduate degree, after which I moved to the United States in 2009 to pursue my graduate degree in Computer Science.

  My passion lies in providing the best Customer Support Experience possible. I have worked with a range of different languages and  technology stacks and I am always looking for opportunities to work on something new.
