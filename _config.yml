  Hi, my name is Aatish and I am an Engineer with over 10 years of industry experience. 

  I am currently working at LinkedIn as a Senior Site Reliabilty Engineer.

  Born and raised in Mumbai, where I completed my schooling and undergraduate degree, after which I moved to the United States in 2009 to pursue my graduate degree in Computer Science.

  My passion lies in providing the best Customer Support Experience possible. I have worked with a range of different languages and  technology stacks and I am always looking for opportunities to work on something new.
