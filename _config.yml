  Hi, my name is Aatish, Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer with over 10 years experience, based in the Washington D.C. Metro Area. 

  I am currently working for Amazon Web Services as a Systems Engineer.

  Born and raised in Mumbai, where I completed my schooling and undergraduate degree, after which I moved to the United States in 2009 to pursue my graduate degree in Computer Science.

  My passion lies in providing the best Customer Support Experience possible. I have worked with a range of different languages and  technology stacks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new.
