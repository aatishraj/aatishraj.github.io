  Hi, my name is Aatish, Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer with over 10 years experience, based in the Bay Area. I am currently working for Verizon Media within Yahoo Mail as a Production Engineer on the Metadata Cache and Search platform. Born and raised in Mumbai, I moved to the United States of America in 2009 to pursue my Post Graduation Degree in Computer Science.

  My passion lies in providing the best Customer Support Experience possible. I have worked with a range of different languages and  technology stacks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new.
